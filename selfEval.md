# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

I have been exposed to a lot of new information however I feel comfortable with my progress.  The challenges have enough scafolding and build the tools to help me push forward. I also feel good exploring outside resources and experimenting with the code I write to see how the outcomes change as I make modifications to my code.    



- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

I feel great about the schedule and space I have created.  I have been very good about keeping productive yet enabling myself time and space for breaks and self care.  





- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

Syntax will continue to be challenging for me.  I want to remember that patience and persistance are both my allies.
